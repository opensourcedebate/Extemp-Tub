# Extemp-Tub
An Open Source Platform for Automated Retrieval, Collection, and Sorting of News Articles for Usage in Extemporaneous Speaking Competitions

Article collection can be continuously or incrementally set by the user. Articles are gathered from user-specified Reddit subreddits, such as /r/news, /r/worldnews, and /r/technology. Once articles have been gathered, they will be added into a database, as to prevent multiple copies of the same article from being stored. By defualt, all links to imgur and youtube are ignored.
